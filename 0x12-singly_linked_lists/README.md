0x12-C singly linked list project.

THIS IS A README.md file.

This project demostrates how a singly linked list can be used to manipulated data structures. Elements are represented as nodes, which comprised of data and a pointer to the next node. The head is the first node, while the tail which is the last node points to a null. it's a prefered option to using an array, as it allocates more memory space, allows addition or deletion of data at various points.

for this project i will be doing the following task;
1) Create a repository and required files
2) create a _putchar.c function
3) create a main.h header file, containing all my proteotypes
4) write a function that prints all the element of a list
5) write a function that returns the number of elments in a list
6) write a function that adds new nodes at the beginning of list
7) writes a function that adds a new node at the end of a list
8) write a function that frees the list 
9) write a function that prints a string before the main function
10) Write a 64-bit program in assembly that prints a string
